A Project by Grad Students: Bhardvaj Lukhi, Kuldeep Padhiyar, Darsh Parikh, Shruti Saini and Jenish Patel

We are developing a Web application to make community around the best movies of all time based on user reviews. Target audience for our product will be young folks who has most interest in the movies and can eventually form community that can grow all together and shares its vision. We will develop a website that leads the user to rate all movies, comment on their fact reviews about them, and add movies to favorite as well as informative to their list. Here, every user can search for their friends to access their wish list and suggest movie. To develop this project, we are using the scrum model as a software life cycle. We have eight weeks of the timeline and four milestones. We organized scrum meetings with our customers to accomplish all the features mentioned above and a fully working web application.

Thank you
